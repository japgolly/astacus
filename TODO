Handle cds
understand album types
have a flag or something for album art

what about when ape/id3 tags differ - should create 2 tracks with same AF
what about when scanner hits a file already in the system

LOCATIONS
=========
(2) Rescan in background
(2) Admin view error queue
(2) Admin replay items on error queue
(3) Stats page with total and per-label stats
(4) Deleting a location should delete all its audio_files but preserve its audio_contents
    (What about tracks/albums/etc? Should keep and mark as non active? Or should all tags be on audio content?)
