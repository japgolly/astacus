Fix: backgroundrb spams logs. Can we shut it up?
Fix: cant filter by year=NULL

Add a home page.
Add links on the stats/search pages to switch back and forth.
Add a little nav bar to the global template.

BROWSING
========
* Click on a track shows/hides track details
* Flat/Table album view
* Flat/Table file view
* Flat/Table track view
* Save searches
* Display searches from main page
* Add remaining filter criteria
  - album type
  - track.format
  - track.length
  - track.bitrate
  - file.size
  - file.dirname
  - file.basename
  - other.age
  - results/page
* Add a reset button
* Change sort order

DOWNLOADS
=========
* Add download links (full album)
* Create users and only provide download links if the user is logged in
* Log ALL downloads (user, time, filesize, ip, etc)
* Have a cart, add files and albums to it then it zips it all up and sends

SCANNING
========
* Handle cds like 'Disc A - Paris 1937'
* Handle case where we have two cds: 'CD 1 - Paris 1937', 'CD 1 - Germany'
* understand album types
* add support for flac, ape, m4a (mp4?), wma (maybe)
* should generate thumbnails for large images
* what about when ape/id3 tags differ - should create 2 tracks with same AF
* Record last mod date on audio files.
* When scanning have an option to only scan new files and files updated since last scan.
* AC/DC Black Ice length and bitrate is way off (210:16, 90.8 MB, MP3, 59 kbps)
* Make scanning use backgroundrb's thread-pool features

TAGS
====
* Remove labels from locations
* Add a location/dir tag. Applies to audio_files. Filters on dirname.
* The SQ.taglist should handle this: "jap, !staged"

LOCATIONS
=========
(2) Rescan in background
(2) Admin view error queue
(2) Admin replay items on error queue
(4) Deleting a location should delete all its audio_files but preserve its audio_contents
    (What about tracks/albums/etc? Should keep and mark as non active? Or should all tags be on audio content?)

STATS
=====
* Provide links in graphs to a search with that filter applied
* Save SQ etc

WARNINGS

* Display different types of warnings.
* Display a graph of warnings over time.

  - Images with bad mimetypes
  - Audio tags with apic tags but no albumart
  - Albums where albumart is inconsistant between tracks (i.e. missing from some, diff pic on some)

  - Audio files with no tracks
  - Albums with a single non-0 cd
  - Albums with 0 and non-0 cds
