Fix: large insert SQLs going into log files
Fix: backgroundrb spams logs. Can we shut it up?

SCANNING
========
* Handle cds like 'Disc A - Paris 1937'
* Handle case where we have two cds: 'CD 1 - Paris 1937', 'CD 1 - Germany'
* understand album types
* add support for flac, ape, m4a (mp4?), wma (maybe)
* should generate thumbnails for large images
* what about when ape/id3 tags differ - should create 2 tracks with same AF
* BUG: Lamb of God had bad pic, autotagged, re-ran scanner, now double the tracks and bad image

TAGS
====
* Remove labels from locations
* Add a location/dir tag. Applies to audio_files. Filters on dirname.
* The SQ.taglist should handle this: "jap, !staged"

LOCATIONS
=========
(2) Rescan in background
(2) Admin view error queue
(2) Admin replay items on error queue
(4) Deleting a location should delete all its audio_files but preserve its audio_contents
    (What about tracks/albums/etc? Should keep and mark as non active? Or should all tags be on audio content?)

WARNINGS
========
* Images over 1 meg
* Images with bad mimetypes
* Audio tags with apic tags but no albumart
* Albums where albumart is inconsistant between tracks (i.e. missing from some, diff pic on some)
* Audio files with multiple tracks (i.e. mismatch between tag metadata)
* Audio files with no tracks
* Albums with a single non-0 cd
* Albums with 0 and non-0 cds
* Duplicates
* replaygain missing
* album replaygain different between cd tracks
* Missing tracks (eg. 1,2,6,7,8)
* Albums without albums art
* Dirs with multiple artist tags
* Discs split across multiple dirs (disc:dir should be 1:1)
* Make sure that max tracks/discs is correct
* Check replaygain

FUTURE FEATURES
===============
* Show stats by age buckets
* Show stats over time (i.e. graph)
